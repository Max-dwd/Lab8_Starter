- Graceful degradation is all about ensuring the site still works—even if some advanced features aren’t available—by falling back to simpler behavior. Service workers embody this principle by intercepting network requests: if the user is offline or a resource fails to load, the worker can return a cached copy instead. In this way, service workers provide a built-in fallback layer that keeps the application functional and responsive when the network or certain APIs aren’t available, exemplifying graceful degradation in web apps.
